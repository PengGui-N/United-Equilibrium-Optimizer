% Computes the value of the Styblinski-Tank benchmark function.
% SCORES = STYBLINSKITANKFCN(X) computes the value of the Styblinski-Tank  
% function at point X. STYBLINSKITANKFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 
% and returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
