% Computes the value of the McCormick benchmark function.
% SCORES = MCCORMICKFCN(X) computes the value of the McCormick function 
% at point X. MCCORMICKFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 and returns a 
% vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value 
% for the corresponding row of X. For more information please visit:
