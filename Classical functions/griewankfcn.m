% Computes the value of the Griewank benchmark function.
% SCORES = GRIEWANKFCN(X) computes the value of the Griewank's
% function at point X. GRIEWANKFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N 
% and returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
