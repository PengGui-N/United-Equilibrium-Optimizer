% Computes the value of the Bartels Conn benchmark function.
% SCORES = BARTELSCONNFCN(X) computes the value of the Bartels Conn 
% function at point X. BARTELSCONNFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 and 
% returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
