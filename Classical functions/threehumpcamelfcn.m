% Computes the value of the Three-hump camel benchmark function.
% SCORES = THREEHUMPCAMELFCN(X) computes the value of the Three-hump camel   
% function at point X. THREEHUMPCAMELFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2  
% and returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
