% Computes the value of the Drop-Wave benchmark function.
% SCORES = DROPWAVEFCN(X) computes the value of the Drop-Wave function at 
% point X. DROPWAVEFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 and returns a  
% vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value 
% for the corresponding row of X.
