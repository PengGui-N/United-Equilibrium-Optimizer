% Computes the value of Bohachevsky N. 1 benchmark function.
% SCORES = BOHACHEVSKYN1FCN(X) computes the value of the Bohachevsky N. 1
% function at point X. BOHACHEVSKYFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N and 
% returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for each row of X.
