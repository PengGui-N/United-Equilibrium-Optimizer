% Computes the value of the Salomon's benchmark function.
% SCORES = SALOMONFCN(X) computes the value of the Salomon's   
% function at point X. SALOMONFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N  
% and returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
