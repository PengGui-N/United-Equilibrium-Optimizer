% Computes the value of the Easom benchmark function.
% SCORES = EASOMFCN(X) computes the value of the Easom function at point X.
% EASOMFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 and returns a vetor SCORES of 
% size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value for the 
% corresponding row of X. For more information please visit:
