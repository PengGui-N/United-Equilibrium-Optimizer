% Computes the value of the Exponential function.
% SCORES = EXPONENTIALFCN(X) computes the value of the Exponential
% function at point X. EXPONENTIALFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-N and 
% returns a vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the 
% function value for the corresponding row of X.
