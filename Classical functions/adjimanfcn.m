% Computes the value of the Adjiman benchmark function.
% SCORES = ADJIMANHFCN(X) computes the value of the Adjiman function at 
% point X. ADJIMANHFCN accepts a matrix of size M-by-2 and returns a  
% vetor SCORES of size M-by-1 in which each row contains the function value 
% for the corresponding row of X.
